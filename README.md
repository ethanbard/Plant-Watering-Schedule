This is my solution to the Tandem Apprenticeship Coding Challenge. It is a ReactJS project that was bootstraped with Create React App. 

To run the app, go to the project directory in your command line and run "npm start". Your browser should open automatically. If it doesn't, open the browser and go to [http://localhost:3000].

There shouldn't be any issues with the code, but I wrote it in Windows, so I don't know if it will run on Mac or Linux.

An additional feature I would like to have added is the ability to edit the plant JSON file through the app.
